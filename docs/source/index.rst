.. admonition:: In a Nutshell, OntoBrAPI:

   * Receives as input a Miappe compliant Excel file
   * Validates it according to the Miappe specifications
   * Makes your metadata and associated data available through various search engines, so more people can find your data.


Make your data FAIR using OntoBrAPI
-----------------------------------

FAIR data is increasingly more valued in research, with new projects tending to follow FAIR guidelines when working with their data.

OntoBrAPI aims to increase data FAIRness by making it searchable and readily acessible by specialized databases, such as **FAIDARE**.
This is achieved by making your data compatible with the Breeding API (BrAPI), which is incorporated by specialized databases.
