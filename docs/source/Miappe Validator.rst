Input File Format
=================

OntoBrAPI checks for the extension of your input file. If it does not end with .xls or .xlsx, the validator will through an error message resulting in submission failure.

It checks sheet names, number of sheets, the column headers in all sheets, and a simple review of the content of each sheet and their respective formats.
